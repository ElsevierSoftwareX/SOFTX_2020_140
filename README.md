CMIP6-D&amp;A: An R-based software for processing climate data available in network common data format

ABSTRACT:
 CMIP6-D&A is an R-based open source software with a user-friendly graphical user interface that 
 is being developed to download and process climate data such as daily precipitation, minimum and 
 maximum near surface air temperature stored/available in the network common data format
 (netCDF). Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of CMIP6-D&A in downloading, subsetting, and 
 analyzing the netCDF files, and generating several outputs in netCDF and comma-separated values 
(CSV) file formats for Alberta, Canada. In addition, the CMIP6-D&A program can easily be 
 modifiable by users for applications in different part of the globe.
